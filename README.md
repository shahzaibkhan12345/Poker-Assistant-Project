# ♠️ GTO Poker Assistant (Trainer Edition)

A local, desktop assistant designed to provide Game Theory Optimal (GTO) pre-flop suggestions for 6-max No-Limit Hold'em cash games.

**Target Audience:** macOS (Client) and Windows (Developer/Testing).

## ✨ Core Features

*   **GTO Decision Logic:** Provides instant, pre-programmed optimal play suggestions (Raise, Call, Fold).
*   **Cross-Platform:** Built using Electron for native desktop deployment on macOS (`.dmg`) and Windows (`.exe` installer).
*   **Offline Operation:** The application runs entirely locally—no internet connection required after launch.
*   **Training-Focused Interface:** Simple UI for manual input of position, hand, and scenario.
*   **Basic Hand Memory:** Stores the last 20 hands/decisions in a session for internal tracking.

## 🛑 Important Disclaimers

**THIS IS A TRAINER, NOT A BOT.**

*   **NO Automation:** This app does not interact with, scrape, or automate any poker client (including GGPoker).
*   **Manual Input Only:** Decisions are based purely on data manually entered by the user.

# 1. Developer Guide (Windows Development Workflow)

This section is for the project maintainer (you) and covers setting up, testing on Windows, and generating the final Mac application.

### 🛠️ Step 1: Local Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Node.js (LTS version)](https://nodejs.org/en) and Git installed on your Windows machine.
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
    cd poker-gto-assistant
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 💻 Step 2: Testing and Debugging on Windows

Use the `npm start` command for rapid development and testing.

1.  **Run the App (Development Mode):**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    *   **Purpose:** This launches the application directly from source. Use `Ctrl + Shift + I` to open Developer Tools for debugging the logic.
2.  **Test Windows Production Build (Optional):**
    ```bash
    npm run build:win
    ```
    *   Find the installer/executable in the newly created `dist/` folder for local production testing.

### 🚀 Step 3: Generating the macOS Deliverable (Via GitHub Actions)

To create the final, production-ready applications for both operating systems, commit your changes and push to the `main` branch or create a version tag (e.g., `git tag v1.0.0; git push --tags`). The final build files will be automatically generated by GitHub's macOS and Windows servers.

1.  **Commit and Push Final Code:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Final GTO logic and code changes ready for client build"
    git push
    ```
2.  **Download Artifacts from GitHub:**
    *   Navigate to your repository's **Actions** tab.
    *   Click on the latest completed workflow run.
    *   Scroll to the **Artifacts** section to download the ready-to-use binaries:
        *   **`macOS-GTO-Assistant`** (Contains the `.dmg` for the Mac Client)
        *   **`Windows-GTO-Assistant`** (Contains the installer for testing/distribution)

# 2. Client Guide (Installation and Usage)

This section contains all the instructions your Mac client needs to install and run the application successfully.

### 🛠️ Quick Installation Guide (macOS)

Please follow these **3 simple steps** to install and launch the application:

1.  **Unzip the File:** Unzip the downloaded artifact ZIP file. You will find the installer file: **`GTO Poker Assistant-1.0.0.dmg`** (the version number may vary).
2.  **Install the App:**
    *   **Double-click the `.dmg` file.** A small window will pop up showing the app icon and a shortcut to your Applications folder.
    *   **Drag the `GTO Poker Assistant.app` icon** and drop it onto the **Applications** folder shortcut. This copies the app to your system.
3.  **Initial Launch & Security Bypass (Crucial Step):**
    *   Close the installer window and **eject the Disk Image** (right-click the mounted drive).
    *   Open your **Applications** folder.
    *   **CRUCIAL:** **Right-Click** (or Control-Click) the **`GTO Poker Assistant.app`** icon.
    *   Select **"Open"** from the menu.
    *   A warning dialog will appear (e.g., "app cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"). Click **"Open"** to grant permission.

> **Note:** macOS only asks for this permission the first time. After this, you can launch the app normally by double-clicking it.

### 📝 How to Use Your Trainer

The app is ready for manual input of **Position**, **Hand**, and **Scenario**. The output panel will give instant GTO guidance:

| Output Action | Meaning & Guidance | UI Color |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RAISE [Amount]** | The optimal aggressive move (e.g., 3-Bet to 9BB). | **Green** |
| **CALL (Flatted)** | The optimal defensive/passive move. | **Yellow** |
| **FOLD** | The hand is outside the optimal range. | **Red** |
| **FOLD... [Reason]** | The requested spot is uncoded/unknown. | **Red** |
